TrustLens: Assessing Website Safety via OCR Technology

Protective, teachable tooling for safer browsing and link awareness.

TrustLens is a lightweight web application scaffolded with React + Vite for the UI, with companion folders for an OCR component and a conversational “Chatbot” module. The goal is to help users extract text/URLs (including from images) and interact through a helper interface for safer decision-making around links and online content (e.g., phishing awareness and triage).

The repo currently contains a React frontend (src/, public/) and two feature folders: OCR/ and Chatbot/. The default README generated by Vite is still present, and the codebase is mostly JavaScript with some Python.

Features

Modern React UI built with Vite for fast dev experience and hot-module reload. 
GitHub

OCR module (folder present): intended to extract text/URLs from screenshots or images to support safe-browsing checks and awareness. (Implementation details depend on what you add under OCR/.) 
GitHub

Chatbot module (folder present): conversational helper for explanations, walkthroughs, or safety prompts. (Hook it to the UI or run as a service.) 
GitHub

Note: The top-level README in the repo is still the default “React + Vite” template; this file replaces it.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js v18+ (recommended) and npm

(Optional, for OCR) Python 3.10+ and venv

1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/EduSinusi/TrustLens_project.git
cd TrustLens_project

2) Install frontend dependencies
npm install

3) Run the dev server
npm run dev


Open the local URL that Vite prints in your terminal.

4) (Optional) Set up OCR

If you plan to use the OCR/ utilities:

cd OCR
python -m venv .venv
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install your OCR deps here (e.g., pytesseract/opencv/etc.)
# NOTE: add a requirements.txt when finalized
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (create this file)


TODO: add an OCR/README.md describing the exact commands, dependencies, and how the OCR service integrates with the React app.

Development Scripts

Typical Vite scripts (see package.json):

npm run dev       # Start dev server with HMR
npm run build     # Production build
npm run preview   # Preview locally the production build


The repo includes package.json and vite.config.js; if you add custom scripts, document them here.

Configuration

Create a .env at the project root for any runtime configuration you decide to use:

# Examples (rename to what you actually need)
VITE_APP_TITLE=TrustLens
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000


If the OCR or Chatbot modules require API keys or model endpoints, document them here and never commit secrets.

Roadmap

 Connect Chatbot to the UI (route, component, or widget)

 Finalize OCR pipeline and document dependencies (OCR/README.md)

 Add safe-browsing checks (e.g., URL reputation service) with user-friendly explanations

 Provide test coverage for core flows (unit + E2E)

 Add Docker for one-command local setup

 Publish a demo build (GitHub Pages or Vercel/Netlify)

You can track high-level notes in report.txt until issues/milestones are created.
