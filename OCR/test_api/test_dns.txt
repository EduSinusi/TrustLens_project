How the Security Score Works
The security score is like a grade (from 0 to 100) that tells you how safe or risky a website is based on different checks. Here’s how it’s calculated in simple terms:

Starting Point: Every website starts with a perfect score of 100.
Checks for Problems: The tool looks at different parts of the website (like its DNS, email setup, or web security) and checks for issues.
Subtract Points for Risks: If something risky is found, points are taken away from the score. The bigger the risk, the more points are lost:
Critical Risk: Takes away 50 points (e.g., if the website doesn’t exist).
High Risk: Takes away 20-30 points (e.g., if it uses an old, unsafe TLS version or is flagged as malicious).
Medium Risk: Takes away 5-15 points (e.g., if it’s missing some security features like DMARC or has a slow DNS).
Low Risk: No points lost (everything is good).
Final Score: After all checks, the score is adjusted to stay between 0 and 100 (it can’t go below 0 or above 100).
80-100: Very safe (Secure).
50-79: Okay but needs some fixes (Moderate).
0-49: Not safe (Insecure).
Think of it like a health check for a website: the more problems it has, the lower its score gets.

All Features Explained in Simple Words
Here’s what each feature does, why it matters, and how it affects the score:

DNS Resolution
What It Does: Checks if the website’s name (like "google.com") turns into an IP address (like "142.250.190.78") and measures how fast it happens.
Why It Matters: If it doesn’t work, the website might not exist or could be broken. Slow responses might mean trouble.
Score Impact:
Fails completely (doesn’t exist): -50 (critical).
Slow (>500ms): -5 (medium).
Works fine: No change (low).
Domain Age
What It Does: Finds out how old the website is by checking when it was registered.
Why It Matters: New websites (less than 7 days old) might be scams. Older ones are usually safer.
Score Impact:
Less than 7 days: -15 (medium).
Can’t find age: -10 (medium).
Older and known: No change (low).
MX Records
What It Does: Looks at the email servers the website uses.
Why It Matters: Trusted email providers (like Google) are safer. Unknown ones might be risky.
Score Impact:
Unknown email servers: -10 (medium).
Trusted or no email: No change (low).
SPF/DKIM/DMARC (Email Security)
What It Does: Checks if the website has rules to stop fake emails (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
Why It Matters: Without these, someone could pretend to be the website and send scam emails.
Score Impact:
No SPF: -10 (medium).
Weak SPF (lets anyone send): -20 (high).
No DKIM or DMARC: -10 each (medium).
All missing: -30 (high).
All good: No change (low).
DNSSEC
What It Does: Checks if the website’s DNS has a special lock (DNSSEC) to prevent hacking.
Why It Matters: Without it, someone could trick your computer into going to a fake site.
Score Impact:
No DNSSEC: -10 (medium).
Has DNSSEC: No change (low).
Reverse DNS
What It Does: Checks if the IP address points back to the website’s name.
Why It Matters: If they don’t match, it might be a sign of something fishy.
Score Impact:
No match or missing: -10 (medium).
Matches: No change (low).
HTTP/HTTPS Availability
What It Does: Tests if the website works over the web and uses HTTPS (secure connection).
Why It Matters: HTTPS keeps your data safe. No HTTPS or broken web means trouble.
Score Impact:
No HTTPS: -15 (medium).
HTTPS broken (bad certificate): -25 (high).
HTTPS with no HSTS (extra security): -15 (medium).
Works fine with HTTPS: No change (low).
Blacklist Status
What It Does: Checks if the website’s IP is on a list of bad sites (like spam or malware).
Why It Matters: Being on a blacklist means it’s likely dangerous.
Score Impact:
On blacklist: -30 (high).
Not listed: No change (low).
VirusTotal Reputation
What It Does: Asks VirusTotal if the website is known for bad stuff (needs an API key).
Why It Matters: It’s like checking with a security expert to see if the site is shady.
Score Impact:
Flagged as malicious: -30 (high).
Suspicious: -15 (medium).
Clean: No change (low).
GeoIP Location
What It Does: Finds out where the website’s server is (city, country, company).
Why It Matters: Just info to know where it’s hosted—no risk unless something fails.
Score Impact:
Always 0 (low), just for info.
Subdomain Enumeration
What It Does: Looks for extra website names (like "www.google.com" or "mail.google.com").
Why It Matters: Shows if there are hidden parts that might need checking.
Score Impact:
Always 0 (low), just for info.
CAA Records
What It Does: Checks if the website controls who can give it a security certificate.
Why It Matters: Without this, someone could fake the website’s security.
Score Impact:
No CAA: -10 (medium).
Has CAA: No change (low).
IPv6 Support
What It Does: Checks if the website works with the newer internet system (IPv6).
Why It Matters: Shows if it’s ready for the future—no risk if it’s only IPv4.
Score Impact:
Always 0 (low), just for info.
TLS Versions
What It Does: Checks the security version used for HTTPS (like TLS 1.2 or 1.3).
Why It Matters: Old versions (like TLS 1.0) are weak and hackable.
Score Impact:
Old version (TLS 1.0/1.1): -20 (high).
Okay version (TLS 1.2): No change (low).
Best version (TLS 1.3): No change (low).
